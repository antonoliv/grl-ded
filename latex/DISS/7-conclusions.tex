\chapter{Conclusions} \label{chap:conclusions}

In conclusion, this report establishes a solid foundation for implementing and proposing concrete improvements to \ac{GRL} techniques and efficiently solve the problem of \ac{DED} in graph-based environments. \par
We concluded in the literature review, that \ac{GRL} is already a promising solution for \ac{DED}, yielding better performance than other approaches. In general, \acp{GNN} are an ubiquitous method, throughout the gathered literature, for extracting efficient environment topological representations. The identified limitations of existent implementations lie on their lack of: (1) scalability to larger environments, resulting in a significant decrease in computation performance; (2) a seamless integration between \ac{GNN} and \ac{DRL} algorithms and (3) adaptability to real-time topology changes. \par
Moreover, we aim to study how to tackle these limitations by implementing different \ac{GRL} approaches for solving the \ac{DED} problem and conducting a comparative study between the different techniques. The implementations will be compromised of various combinations of \acp{GNN}, for efficiently extracting the relevant environment features, and \ac{DRL} algorithms for mapping the extracted representations into optimal action sequences. Case studies will be carried out within different size modified IEEE bus systems for testing the various models and confront their results. Lastly, the models will be analysed considering their training efficiency, computational performance, dispatch efficiency, scalability to large scenarios and adaptability to topological changes. Based on the conclusions drawn from the comparative study, we will propose a \ac{GRL} that implements concrete enhancements.
