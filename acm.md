# ACM Computing Classification System

**Computing Methodologies -> Machine Learning -> Learning Paradigms -> Reinforcement Learning** - The main objective of my dissertation is to study how to optimize and enhance graph-based decision-making through reinforcement learning techniques.
**Mathematics of Computing -> Discrete Mathematics -> Graph Theory**  - Graph structures and graph theory also play a central role in this project. This thesis will study how to best use the knowledge gathered from this area together with reinforcement learning techniques, a topic that even though has seen significant progress in the last few years is still considered to be in its early stages, with ongoing developments and opportunities for further exploration.
**Applied Computing -> Operations Research -> Transportation / Applied Computing** -> Computers in other domains - The research will be applied to Smart Grid and/or Smart Mobility services, technologies closely related to some of the current global challenges associated with sustainable transport and energy systems.
