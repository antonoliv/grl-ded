## Proposal Context

**Graph Reinforcement Learning** (GRL) has gained significant relevance and has been an active research field in recent years. It combines **Reinforcement Learning** techniques with **graph structures**, often used to represent a network of connected data, enabling learning, optimizing, and decision-making in a wide variety of scenarios where the underlying structure of the data is **graph-based**. It focuses on problems where the data or the problem domain can be represented as a graph, and agents **learn to make decisions and perform actions** within that graph. 

Considering some of the current global challenges, there are a number of concerns closely related to **sustainable transport** and **energy systems**, where GRL can play a relevant role in helping to mitigate them, notably through the contributions of **Smart Mobility** and **Smart Grid** systems and services, such as reducing emissions, promoting energy efficiency, integrating renewable energy, and optimizing system operations, in a way to make it more **intelligent**, more **efficient** and more **sustainable**. 


## Objectives

This project aims to **make an exploratory and empirical study** of Graph Reinforcement Learning techniques, having as particular application domains **Smart Mobility** and **Smart Grids**, two areas of current relevance in the context of global issues, somehow interconnected and related to **transport** and **energy supply optimization**. 


## Innovative Aspects

This work contributes with a **systematic study and analysis** of Graph Reinforcement Learning techniques to **improve the smart mobility and smart grid services**, taking into account real-time and dynamic data, and factors such as demand, supply, availability, and constraints, leading to more efficient, sustainable, and intelligent solutions.
