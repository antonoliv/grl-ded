## Graph Neural Networks

~
	In conclusion, \ac{GRL} is very promising field, where several different applications and techniques were already studied. \acp{GNN} architectures such as \ac{GCN} have been extensively applied with DRL algorithms for enabling feature extracting from graph-based state representations \cite{lengGraphConvolutionalNetworkbased2021}  \cite{liNovelGraphReinforcement2022}, \cite{chenScalableGraphReinforcement2023} \cite{chenAutonomousExplorationUncertainty2020}. Other architectures such as the GraphSAGE  have also been successfully applied with very promising results \cite{peiEmergencyControlStrategy2023} \cite{xingRealtimeOptimalScheduling2023} in comparison with \acp{GCN}, although not as much research has been conducted in their integration with DRL algorithms. This suggests that a possible improvement and research direction of \ac{GRL} techniques might be connected with exploring the use of different \acp{GNN} architectures.
