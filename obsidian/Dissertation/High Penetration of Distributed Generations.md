  
The high penetration of distributed generation (DG) in the context of power grids refers to the widespread integration of small-scale,

decentralized electricity generation sources into the existing electrical grid infrastructure. Distributed generation sources are typically

located closer to the end-users or loads, such as residential homes, commercial buildings, or industrial facilities, and can be renewable or non-renewable sources. This phenomenon is significant because it represents a shift from the traditional centralized power generation model to a more distributed and diverse energy landscape.
